# Changelog

Release notes for Connector Control. The section matching the tagged version
is embedded into the Sparkle update dialog and used as the GitHub release
notes — the release build fails if the section is missing.

## v1.3.0

- Windows: first preview builds (Velopack installer, tray app).
- Windows: a native system-tray port of the Mac app for Windows 10 (build
  17763 and later) and Windows 11, x64 and arm64, sharing the `mcps.json`
  master list format so one synced list serves both platforms.

## v1.2.3

Reliability release: fixes from a full code review of 1.1.4–1.2.2.

- Environment variable editing no longer silently alters data: a value
  without a name blocks saving instead of vanishing, variable names are
  preserved exactly as written (no more surprise whitespace trimming), and
  switching to the JSON view enforces the same duplicate-name validation as
  Save.
- Notifications are truthful and complete: no "config regenerated" banner
  when the write actually failed (a failure now gets its own banner, once),
  a synced change that can't be applied is announced instead of silent, and
  banners now show even while Connector Control is the active app.
- Update feed hardening: version numbers (not build counters) order updates,
  and prerelease tags can no longer reach the auto-update feed.
- Deleting or breaking the connector-list file mid-session can no longer
  wipe Claude's config — the app restores its own list instead.
- Backup ordering is immune to daylight-saving clock rollbacks (timestamps
  are now UTC).

## v1.2.2

- Release notes now appear in the update dialog: the changelog is embedded
  into the update feed, so **Check for Updates…** shows what changed before
  you install.

## v1.2.1

- Settings cleanup: the About tab is gone — the current version now lives in
  Settings ▸ General ▸ Updates — and the settings window is taller so the
  General tab no longer needs a scrollbar.

## v1.2.0

- Built-in auto-update (Sparkle): updates download and install automatically,
  configurable in Settings ▸ General ▸ Updates. This release must be
  installed manually; later versions arrive on their own.
